### Welcome

To make your start here go as smoothly and easily as possible, we have organized a lot of events during the week from 7st to 12th of October before the lectures begin. At TU Dresden the *orientation week* is referred to as *ESE*. Unfortunately, some of those events take place during the math preparatory courses ("Brückenkurs"). We recommend attending the "ESE", especially, as there is an online course available again this year.

### First Things First

<div class="info">Please use the "Get Started" info page for additional information for different courses of study at the Faculty of Computer Science. <a href="https://tu-dresden.de/ing/informatik/studium/so-gehts-los?set_language=en" target="_blank">Click here</a> </div>

The ESE starts with breakfast on Monday, 7st October at 9am. Please bring your **student id** (Studentenausweis), your **photo id**, the **Emeal certificate** (E*meal* Bescheinigung) and **10€** (5€ deposit and 5€ or more credit) for the canteen-card E*meal*. You can find more information on the [website of the Studentenwerk Dresden](http://www.studentenwerk-dresden.de/english/mensen/emeal.html). You can get your personal canteen-card every day during the breakfast.
An extensive collection of everything you need to know can also be found in [this](https://github.com/fsr/nopanic/releases/download/v{{site.year}}/manual_compressed.pdf) brochure (german only).

Every new student at the Faculty of Computer Science is invited to join the ESE. In addition to the main events organized by us there are dedicated introductory meetings for other study paths than pure Computer Science or Media Computer Science. Have a look.


During the ESE week you can recognize helpers by their beautiful `#018554` t-shirts. Simply walk up to them and talk to them. You can ask them anything, no need to be shy. Of course you can always contact the FSR via email, phone or social media. The office should be occupied as well at all times during the week.
