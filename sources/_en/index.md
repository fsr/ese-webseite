### Welcome

To make your start here go as smoothly and easily as possible, we have organized a lot of events during the week from 19th to 23rd of October before the lectures begin. At TU Dresden the *orientation week* is referred to as *ESE*. Unfortunately, some of those events take place during the math preparatory courses ("Br√ºckenkurs"). We recommend attending the "ESE", especially, as there is an online course available again this year.

During the ESE week you can recognize helpers by their beautiful `#056d85` t-shirts. Simply walk up to them and talk to them. You can ask them anything, no need to be shy. Of course you can always contact the FSR via email, phone or social media. The office should be occupied as well at all times during the week.
