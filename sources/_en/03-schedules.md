But first here's a list of the used abbreviations with links to their respective websites.

* **AUD**: [Algorithmen und Datenstrukturen](https://www.orchid.inf.tu-dresden.de/teaching/2018ws/aud/){:target="_blank"}
* **DIS**: Diskrete Strukturen (Einführung in die Mathematik für Informatiker)

* **LAG**: [Lineare Algebra](https://www.math.tu-dresden.de/~baumann/lineare_algebra___einfuehrung_in_die_mathematik_fuer_informatiker.html){:target="_blank"} (Einführung in die Mathematik für Informatiker)
* **RA1**: Rechnerarchitektur *(Diploma only)*
* **TGI**: Technische Grundlagen *(Diploma only)*, the lecture **[TGI]** (Di., 3. DS) takes place only in *even* weeks

Not included in these plans is the **Math learning room** on Thursday, 5th and 6th DS in room WIL/B122, where you can get help with any questions you may have (and can also hand in homework), as well as a possible replacement slot for the EMI lecture on Friday, 6th DS in room POT/0081/H.
