As a voluntary event, the first semester introduction, or »ESE« for short, will be photographed and filmed for public purposes.
The recordings are used for print and online purposes of the TU Dresden, the Faculty of Computer Science and the FSR itself.
The recordings can also be used for our sponsors as well as documentation. 

As a result, it is based on Article 6(1) lit. f GDPR, a legitimate interest. 

Thank you for your understanding!
