#### The sights
The first thing that comes to mind is the Old Town, Dresden's historic centre. Many sights such as the Frauenkirche, Zwinger, Fürstenzug and Residenzschloss can be found there.

The quarter on the other side of the Elbe is called Neustadt (New Town). The Golden Horseman, the Japanese Palace, the Pfunds Dairy and the Kunsthof Passage (Art Courtyard Passage) will definitely make your visit worthwhile.

Not far from the campus, there is the Großer Garten (Grand Garden) the green heart of the city with the Dresden Zoo. But also the Blue Wonder and the Dresden railways in Loschwitz are worth a visit or a ride.

For further sightseeing and more detailed information, please refer to the [website of the city of Dresden](https://www.dresden.de/en/tourism/attractions/sights.php){:target="_blank"}.

#### Neustadt
The Neustadt north of the Elbe is considered the Bohemian Quarter of Dresden. Its original flair results from the many small shops, pubs, bars and restaurants along the narrow streets and colourful lanes. A dream come true for every student ;). Every year, the district party *Bunte Republik Neustadt (BRN)* and the aforementioned sights attract thousands of visitors - well deserved!

#### Cinemas, theatres...?
In the city centre there are the *Rundkino* cinema and the *UFA Kristallpalast* cinema. During midsummer the film nights take place on the banks of the Elbe. The *Kino im Kasten* cinema has student prices and is visited by us during the ESE.

Theatre fans can enjoy a wide range of programmes, for example, of the *Staatsschauspiel Dresden* or the *Comödie Dresden*. Musical highlights are the *Dixieland-Festival* and the *Dresden Music Festival*.

#### How to relax and recover
If the meadow at the pond behind the faculty is no longer sufficient, we recommend a visit to the Großer Garten park or the Elbe meadows on the Königsufer with its beautiful view of the old town.

You can also use your free time more actively by taking a walk in the forests of the Dresdner Heide or a bicycle tour along the Elbe.

#### Student clubs
Most cities with big universities have clubs and bars specifically for students. Fortunately Dresden is no exception to this. You can choose between 13 different student clubs to spend your night partying or just relax with your friends at the bar.
An overview can be found on the [page of the Studentenwerk](https://www.studentenwerk-dresden.de/kultur/studentenclubs.html){:target="_blank"}.

Every year in May the [Dresden night hike](https://www.dresdner-nachtwanderung.de/){:target="_blank"} takes place. There is live music, free drinks and shuttle buses between all the clubs.

#### Local transport - How do I get from A to B?
With your student ID card, you can use a large part of the local public transport in the VVO free of charge. It is also valid as a [semester ticket](https://www.vvo-online.de/en/tariff-tickets/special-tickets/semestertickets-153.cshtml){:target="_blank"} for regional transport in Saxony.

Many places in Dresden can also be easily reached by bike - your own one or one of the many [nextbike/sz-bike rental bikes](https://www.stura.tu-dresden.de/nextbike#General){:target="_blank"}. You will find them at many crossroads all over Dresden and extra stations on campus. You can also use this offer free of charge in Dresden and Leipzig within the first hour with your student card.
