### How does studying work?

#### Seminar groups

The first semester and its new experiences can be overwhelming and it may be a little hard to get used to your new life as a
university student. To help you find your way easily in your first year of Uni there are seminar groups in the first semester.
This way you are not on your own in the lecture accompanying exercises, but you'll see familiar faces and friends with whom you can team up to tackle homework and studies together.
Every seminar group comes with a tutor who will give you all the information you need, answer any questions and support you in many matters. For this there will be meetings roughly every four weeks apart, but you can obviously ask urgent questions outside of these meetings.

#### Schedule

You get a schedule according to your seminar group of choice in your first semester. That way you have less organisatory work to do and it is ensured that everyone get's a place in the (sometimes small) classes, but you can still choose the best schedule for you. The schedules are all oriented towards the planned modules for the first semester according to the official study schedule.

<a class="button expand tiny secondary" href="/2018/schedules">This way to the schedules</a>

In the following semesters you'll have to build your own schedule and enroll in lectures and exercises by yourself.

#### Official study schedule (Studienablaufplan)

The official study schedule determines which courses you should cover in which semester, how much time you should allocate for them and how many credit points they yield. It gives you an overview at which time you should do an internship or vacation. Keep in mind though that the order is not mandatory.
You can find the official study schedule on the last page of the [study regulations](#).

#### Modules/courses

Modules can contain lectures, exercises and practical training. The content of a module is recorded in the related module description, which you can find either on the website of the module or in the PDF of the [study regulations](#). In it you'll find the contents and goals of a course, its  prerequisites and the graded performance required.

#### Credit points

Credit points measure the time spent per module or degree by a student. In particular, 1 so called ECTS-point is worth 30 hours of work. How many credit points a module yield is recorded in the official study schedule and in the related module description.

#### ZIH-Login

You will receive your own personal **Uni-Login** from the ZIH (the centre for information services and high performance computing), with which you can log in to your [Mail](https://msx.tu-dresden.de/){:target="_blank"}-Account, the campus wide WiFi "[eduroam](https://tu-dresden.de/zih/dienste/service-katalog/arbeitsumgebung/zugang_datennetz/#section-0){:target="_blank"}" (also available at many other campuses world wide!) and all other uni related platforms. Additionally, you can use it on many platforms to get student discounts, like [Microsofts](https://e5.onthehub.com/WebStore/Welcome.aspx?ws=b05da5a4-749b-e011-969d-0030487d8897&vsro=8 "Microsoft Imagine - Free Microsoft-Licenses"){:target="_blank"} (Free Licenses), Spotify and many more.

#### jExam (Enrollment)

On the online-platform jExam you will enroll in your seminar group and courses, and later receive your **exam results**. On **[Wednesday](/2018/events)** you will choose your seminar group together with a tutor from your seminar group using jExam.

***For all international students - DSE, CL Students and Exchange Students, who only partake in 1-2 semesters at the faculty: please refer to the 'Service Center for International Students' in the room INF/2018.***

#### Mailing lists
All kinds of information relevant to students are distributed via mailing lists. A complete list can be found on the [FSR website](https://www.ifsr.de/studium/mailinglisten/){:target="_blank"). 
### Campus

#### Campus Navigator

The Campus Navigator helps you orient yourself on the campus and get informations about buildings. It is available as [Website](https://navigator.tu-dresden.de/karten/dresden){:target="_blank"} or as app for [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/de/app/campus-navigator-tu-dresden/id722282377){:target="_blank"} and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.tud.campusnavigator&hl=de){:target="_blank"}.

#### Andreas-Pfitzmann-Bau (APB)

The [APB](https://navigator.tu-dresden.de/karten/dresden/geb/apb){:target="_blank"} is the building of the **Faculty Computer Science**. It's the building with the green windows, which you can see on the pictures on the home page and which you will visit every day during ESE. Many of your courses will be held here. Additionally you can find PC pools, workplaces, the FSR-bureau, the student coffee shop ascii and much more. If a seminar room is free, you can use it for your private studies.

#### Canteen

On campus there are multiple [canteens](https://www.studentenwerk-dresden.de/mensen/mensen_cafeterien.html){:target="_blank"} with daily changing [menus](https://www.studentenwerk-dresden.de/mensen/speiseplan/){:target="_blank"}. The canteen closest to the APB is the [Alte Mensa](https://navigator.tu-dresden.de/karten/dresden/geb/m13){:target="_blank"}. You pay with your [Emeal-Card](https://www.studentenwerk-dresden.de/mensen/emeal.html "Studentenwerk Emeal"){:target="_blank"}. The card can be acquired at ESE **everyday during breakfast**. Please note the [requirements](/2018/events).


#### SLUB (Saxon State and University Library)

In the [SLUB](https://navigator.tu-dresden.de/karten/dresden/geb/slub){:target="_blank"} you can borrow free textbooks, lexicons and much else. Simply sign up [online](https://www.slub-dresden.de/service/nutzer-der-slub-werden/){:target="_blank"}. If you can't find what you're looking for, send a request to SLUB and they will add it to their range, as long as it is a reasonable acquisition. Many students use the SLUB as a place to study, as it is quiet and offers many places to work. If you want to study in a group, you can book a room.

#### ascii

[ascii](https://navigator.tu-dresden.de/etplan/apb/00/raum/542100.2220){:target="_blank"}  is a student-operated **coffee shop at APB** with close ties to the FSR. Coffee and cold beverages are very affordable and it's a popular place for students to spend time. If you'd like to involve yourself at ascii, simply talk to one of the members (usually found behind the bar).
