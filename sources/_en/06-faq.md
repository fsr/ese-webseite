### Who can I contact if I have questions or problems?

In the ESE week you get to know many ESE tutors who love to help you with starting problems and are available for all possible questions. During the first semester you will have your seminar group tutors to help you, which you get to know in the ESE. For larger problems, there is the [Fachschaftsrat](https://ifsr.de "FSR"){:target="_blank"}. We also invite you in the university-wide forum [eXma](https://exmatrikulationsamt.de/ "exma"){:target="_blank"} to get in touch with other students.  
In the areas of legal or social counseling the [Studentenwerk Dresden](https://www.studentenwerk-dresden.de/english/soziales/ "Studentenwerk Dresden"){:target="_blank"} and the [Studentenrat](https://www.stura.tu-dresden.de/beratung "StuRa"){:target="_blank"} provide different offers.

### How does the timetable work?

In the first semester you don’t have to worry about this too much. In later semesters, you will get lecture and exercise dates and then you will have to build your own schedule in jExam. For the first semester we have prepared several timetables in which you will enroll yourselves (with our help). You will then be in a seminar group along with all the others who have chosen this timetable. Please do not miss the corresponding meeting on Friday, it is very important.

### How do I find my way around the campus?

In the campus scavenger hunt during the ESE you will already get to know the campus a little. Otherwise, you can use both [static maps](https://tu-dresden.de/service/lageplaene "static maps"){:target="_blank"} and the [campus navigator](https://navigator.tu-dresden.de/ "campus navigator"){:target="_blank"} on the service side of the TU Dresden which support you in reaching your destination.

### What can I expect at the start of the courses?

For the first semester you enrol yourself together with the tutors in the ESE week. The first time of each lecture you will usually get organizational information on individual subjects, but it is also advisable to check the website periodically for changes made to each subject, as there are often lecture notes or exercises provided.

### What else do I have to think about?
